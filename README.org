*Status*: EWS is effectively deprecated, and BasicAuthentication (the only type that we support in EWS is actually being shut down for good soon-ish. As such this repo is now effectively frozen as of 2020-April. 

This is a pure python wrapper for use with Microsoft Exchange Web Services
(EWS). For now it only understands contacts and contact folders.

It was origially developed for use with ASynK -
http://karra-asynk.appspot.com/, a bi-directional contact sync utility that
supports a variety of contact stores incuding Google contacts, MS Outlook, MS
Exchange, CardDAV, and Emacs BBDB.

* Dependencies

  You will need a few python packages which are listed in the
  requirements.txt file, please install them

  Once that is done, you should be able to use this on any platform that runs
  python.

* Getting started

  This is very early days for pyews. You should be look at the file
  tests/misc.py to get an idea of how to get started. (Sorry; it looks
  horrible, I know)

  You must create a file ```auth.txt``` in that directory; it should have three
  lines in it:

  - full_email_adddress@server.com
  - password
  - The mailbox URL for your exchange account (for e.g. ```https://outlook.office365.com/EWS/Exchange.asmx```)

  Once you have that file, you can execute the misc.py as ```python misc.py```
